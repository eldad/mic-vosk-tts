# mic-vosk-tts

A simple test of vosk TTS. Only works on Linux since it requires jack. Can be easily adapted to other operating systems (see `cpal` crate documentation).

Requires vosk systems libraries to compile. On Arch Linux: `pacman -S vosk-api`.

This repo does not include the [vosk model](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models).
